The purpose of this sudoku solver program is to make use of abstract factory and strategy O-O design patterns to implement a set of classes that define the abstractions necessary to solve any kind of puzzle in general, and produce concrete subclasses that implement these interfaces to solve a sudoku puzzle in particular. the program also uses randomized algorithm called Genetic Algorithm(GA).
Implementation and assumptions : --the user will input population size and the maxmimum generation from console --the user will type 81 digits as an input for the original sudoku to be solved --program asks the Population for the bestFitness, halting iterations if a solution has been found or if the maximum number of generations limit has been reached, command the Population to cull 90\% of its Puzzles, and command the Population to reproduce a newGeneration.
INPUT :The program takes two command line arguments: the size of the population and the maximum number of generations. It also reads the sudoku puzzle from cin in a compact text format. The format consists of a sequence of 81 integers, as ASCII text, each corresponding to the contents of one square in the puzzle grid, in row-major order (i.e., starting at the upper left corner, reading across each row and then continuing with the next row, ending at the bottom right corner)
OUTPUT : The program outputs the best puzzle found with its fitness value in the following format to cout. Fitness Value of the best puzzle : X
